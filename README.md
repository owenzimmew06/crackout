## üìñ About This Project

**Crackout** is a classic brick-breaker game, reminiscent of nostalgic titles like *Breakout* and *Arkanoid*. It was built from scratch using **Python** and the **Pygame** library. This project serves as a fun demonstration of game development fundamentals, including:

-   Real-time game loop management
-   User input handling (keyboard controls)
-   2D physics and collision detection
-   Sprite management and rendering
-   State management (tracking score, lives, win/loss conditions)

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Classic Gameplay:** Control the paddle to bounce the ball and destroy all the bricks.
-   **Scoring System:** Earn points for every brick you destroy.
-   **Lives System:** You have 3 lives! If the ball falls past your paddle, you lose a life.
-   **Win/Loss Conditions:** Clear all the bricks to win, or lose all your lives to get a game over.
-   **Responsive Controls:** Smooth paddle movement using the arrow keys.
-   **Dynamic Ball Physics:** The ball's angle changes based on where it hits the paddle.
